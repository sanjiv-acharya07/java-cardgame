# JAVA Cardgame
### Part 1
Part 1 allows users to play and keep score of a custom card game. This part will be ran within the Part1Main class. To run this part, you must add your input file into the "part1/inputs/" directory, and must add the name of your input file in the last part of line 15. To see the output, add the name of your output file into line 13.
The input of Part 1 will contain the instruction (either ADD, DELETE, or PLAY) and the solve method will use the other classes to either add a player, delete a player, or play the game. Once the program is complete, the output will be a list of each player and their scores.

### Part 2
Part 2 allows users to encrypt a player's data using their name and a binary tree. This part will be ran within the Part2Main class. To run this part, you must add your input file into the "part2/inputs/" directory, and must add the name of your input file in the last part of line 14. To see the output, add the name of your output file into line 12.
The input of Part 2 will contain names of players and their scores, number of times, and the instructions for the binary tree traversal. First, the method will add the players into a binary tree using the player names and number of times. Next, the method will use the directions to see if there is a player stored at that node. If there is not, then the output will be -1, but if there is the output will be the player and their score.

### Running
If you would like to run this code, the input file must match the format of the sample input files for both part 1 and 2. Feel free to have fun with the different names and games!
